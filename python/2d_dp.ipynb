    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a grid with `m` rows and `n` columns, you need to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combinatorics Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be solved using combinatorics by recognizing that the task is to choose a sequence of moves (right and down) to reach the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Total Moves**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To go from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, you need to make a total of `m-1` down moves and `n-1` right moves.\n",
    "    - Therefore, the total number of moves required is `(m-1) + (n-1) = m + n - 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choosing Moves**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Out of these `m + n - 2` moves, you need to choose `m-1` moves to be down (or equivalently, `n-1` moves to be right).\n",
    "    - The number of ways to choose `m-1` down moves from `m + n - 2` total moves is given by the binomial coefficient `C(m+n-2, m-1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binomial Coefficient**:\n",
    "    - The binomial coefficient `C(a, b)` is calculated as `a! / (b! * (a - b)!)`, where `!` denotes factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the Python implementation of the combinatorics solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import comb\n",
    "\n",
    "def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n",
    "    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(m+n-2, m-1)\n",
